## A few words about security
+ Watch out for electrical safety! Electric current can be dangerous!
+ Follow the rules for using batteries;
+ Watch out for fire safety!
+ Moving parts can pinch body parts;
+ Various protruding parts may pose a danger to the eyes! Especially the antenna parts. When power is lost, the antenna drops. Watch your eyes!
